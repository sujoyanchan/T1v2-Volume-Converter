Volume Converter for Litres to Gallons conversion

Working
=======
We need to enter volume in litres to get conversion in gallons and vice versa. For this we are making use of the addEventListener() method. 
The input event fires when the value of <input> element has been changed as a direct result of a user action (in our case, typing in a textbox)

Input Validations
=================
alerts are raised when
1. the volume entered in litres or gallons field is negative.
2. the volume entered in litres or gallons field has more than 15 digits. 

=> We have set the max limit for volume entered as 15 digits. 
=> The converted value has been rounded off to 2 decimals.
=> Since the input field type is number for both litres and gallons, we cannot enter spaces and special characters.
